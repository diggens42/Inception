# Inception Project

## üß† Introduction

The **Inception** project is a DevOps-oriented exercise designed to help you master container orchestration using Docker and Docker Compose. Through this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in setting up and managing a complete multi-service infrastructure within a virtualized environment. You‚Äôll learn how to build your own Docker images, configure services to work seamlessly together, and ensure secure and performant inter-container communication. This project touches on a wide range of essential DevOps concepts, including networking, volumes, secure service exposure, and caching.


## üì¶ Project Overview

This infrastructure runs entirely using Docker Compose with self-written Dockerfiles (no pre-made images), and each service runs in its own dedicated container.

### üß± Services & Containers

- **NGINX**
  - Serves as the web server.
  - Supports **TLSv1.2 / TLSv1.3**.
  - Acts as a reverse proxy for WordPress and the static site.

- **WordPress**
  - Runs with **PHP-FPM**
  - Connected to **MariaDB** and **Redis** for database and caching respectively.

- **MariaDB**
  - Database service for WordPress.
  - Data stored in a **dedicated volume**.

- **Redis**
  - Configured to cache WordPress data.

- **FTP Server**
  - Provides file transfer access to the WordPress site files for upload, download, and management.

- **Static Website**
  - A small non-PHP website (e.g., personal portfolio or resume).
  - Hosted by NGINX as a separate subdomain.

- **Adminer**
  - Database management tool for MariaDB.

- **Portainer**
  - Provides a GUI for Docker container and volume management.

## üåê Networking

All services are connected through a **custom Docker network** that enables secure and isolated communication between containers.

## üîß Build & Run

All Docker images are built from the project‚Äôs **Dockerfiles** and managed using a `Makefile`.

Example commands:
```bash
make build   # Builds all Docker images
make up      # Starts all services using docker-compose
make down    # Stops and removes containers and networks
